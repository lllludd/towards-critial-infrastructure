### Notes and first research
##### Laptop Power Drain:
  - Projections of large differential in laptop power draw base of general use, setup, screen size, graphics card type and use etc.
  - low end: 12Wh(thinkpad-x :12.5inch, effeceint setup) high end 90Wh (gaming computer: large screen graphics card etc.)
  - however most computers seem to average towards the bottom of the scale at ?= 30Wh
  - 30 - 40W average

##### Router power drain:
  - 24 hours a day, generally low energy use between 2 and 20 watts
  - 11 watts for linksys wireless router and 5 watts per hour for adls2 modem
