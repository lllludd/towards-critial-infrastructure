    Management*: A new framework for decision making
---

Defining the Whole
==================

> “…the minimum a whole would have to include to be managable is the
> *decision makers* — those directly involved in its management; the
> *resource base*, which refers to the physical resources —— land,
> buildings, equipment, and other assets —— from which you will generate
> revenue or derive support, plus the people who infuence or are
> influenced by your management; and finally the *money* available or
> that can be generated from the resource base.”

> “…no family business or community can be managed in isolation from the
> land that provides the raw materials for life and the repository for
> wastes.” — p. 60

Decision Makers
---------------

> “Decision makers are the people who will form the holistic goal. They
> should include anyone making day-to-day decisions in the family,
> business, corporate division, or whatever entity your whole is based
> on. They should range from those who make the most profound decisions,
> to those making the most mundane decisions — from the owner of the
> coffee shop to the person who serves across the counter; from the
> owner of the ranch to the cowboys handling the cattle; from the
> trustees and faculty of the college to the secretary in the admissions
> office; from the senior partners in the legal firm to the person
> answering the phones. Make a list of the all, trying to be inclusive
> rather than exclusive. If there are people who, while not making
> decisions can veto them or in some way alter them, they should be
> included in this part of the whole.”— p. 60

The Resource Base
-----------------

> “…list the major physical resources from which you will generate
> revenue or derive support in achieving your holistic goal: the land,
> the factory and its machinery, the office building, your home, or
> whatever it relevant in your case. These resources need not be owned,
> but must be available to you. You are not after a detailed list of
> every asset you have, only a very general one ... now make a list of
> all the people you can think of who will or can influence or be
> influenced by the mangement decisions you make, but won’t have the
> power to veto or alter them — clients and customers, suppliers,
> advisors, neighbours, family, and so on. If the entity you are
> managing includes something as large and complex as state lands or a
> national park, the people in your resource base could number in the
> millions. To overcome the dilemma of how to include them all \[if
> groups are very large\], list instead groups of people representative
> of the larger public, for example, environmental groups, community
> organisations, and others concerned about how that land or wildlife is
> managed.” — p. 61

Money
-----

> “…make a note of the sources of money available to you. This might
> include cash on hand or money in a savings account or available from
> relatives, shareholders, or a line of creit at the bank. And it would
> almost always include the money generative from the physical resources
> listed in your resources base. Don’t be sidetracked here by long and
> involved discussions on the meaning of money and wealth. Just think of
> money in terms of what you require to live on, or to run the business,
> institute, government, or whatever entity you are dealing with.” — p.
> 62

Maintain focus on big picture
-----------------------------

> “Try to keep your lists and notes brief. Great detail is not needed
> now, only big-picture clarity.”

> “In your first attempt them, do your best to define your minimum
> whole. The result, no matter how rough, should be adequate to enable
> you to get on with forming your holistic goal, which initially will
> only be temporary anyway. As you work at refining your holistic goal,
> you will be obliged to reconsider your whole.” — p. 65

Wholes within Wholes
--------------------

> “If the group of people you have included in the first part of your
> whole is very large, and if the enterprises engaged in are very
> diverse, or it members are separated from each other geographically,
> it often becomes impractical to manage the entity as a single whole
> …In these cases, it makes more sense to create smaller, more
> manageable wholes within the greater whole. Each of these smaller
> wholes would have to meet the minimum whole requirement ...” — p. 65

> “The primary purpose in creating separate wholes within in the greater
> whole is to give the people within these smaller wholes the
> opportunity to form a holistic goal that relates to specific
> management needs and the resource available to them.”

Holistic Goal
=============

> “Weighing all decisions against this holistic goal increases the
> chances of success in both the short and the long term.”

> “Much of what is expressed in the first two parts — quality of life
> and forms of production —— speaks to immediate needs: people want a
> better life now and to produce things that lead to it. But both parts
> also contain idealistic elements that may not be achieved in a single
> lifetime. The future resource base always speaks to the long term, as
> it must if it is to sustain the rest of what the holistic goal
> encompasses.” — p. 69

The Statement of Purpose
------------------------

> “If the entity you manage was formed for a specific purpose that you
> are *legally or morally obliged to meet*, you will need to ensure that
> your holistic goal addresses this purpose. The best way to do this is
> to create a statement of purpose as a preface to you holistic goal.” —
> p. 69

> “The statement should reflect, in very few words, what you were formed
> to do. If it takes you more than a sentence or two, you have not
> thought carefully enough, or, more commonly, you have gone beyond a
> statement of purpose into *how* you see yourself doing whatever it is
> you are supposed to do.” — p. 70

> “The statement of purpose will be reflected in you holistic goal,
> specifically in the quality of life statement, where you will refer to
> the outcomes that correspond to your purpose, and in the forms of
> production, where you will specify what you must produce to ensure
> those outcomes.” — p.70

Quality of Life
---------------

> “In forming the first part of your holistic goal, you are attempting
> to express how you want you life to be, *in the whole you have
> defined*, based in what you most value. — p. 70

> “…the quality of life statement becomes an expression of the desires
> and aspirations of *all the decision-makers* — a reflection of your
> *shared* values.” — p. 71

> “The quality of life portion of your holistic goal expresses the
> reasons you’re doing what you’re doing, what you are about, and what
> you want to become. It is a reflection of what motivates you. It
> should excite you. It speaks of the needs you want to satisfy now, but
> also of the mission you seek to accomplish in the long run. It is your
> collective sense of what is important and why.” — p. 71

### Four Areas for Consideration

1.  Economic Well-being

    > “…essential for meeting basic human needs of food, clothing,
    > shelter, health, security.”

    > “The practive of expressing what you hope to gain from a
    > thing \[eg. money, car etc.\], rather than the thing itself, can
    > lead to some surprising revelations.” — p. 71

2.  Relationships

    > “…ask yourself how you want to behave with each other and with
    > those listed in your resource base ... you might also consider the
    > qualities of the people you want to associate with or enlist in
    > support of your efforts — future co-workers, organisation members,
    > clients, suppliers, advisors, and so on.”

    > “You want to have a collective sense of what you expect to give
    > and receive from the relationships that are most importatant
    > to you.” — p. 73

3.  Challenge and Growth

    > “Where is the challenge in what you do? Try to think in terms of
    > what you find stimulating, what requires all the resourcefulness
    > and creativity you can muster? Is it important to you to have
    > opportunities to further develop you skills or to enhance the
    > knowledge and talents you already posess?

    > “Think about what kind of atmosphere and environment you might
    > create to ensure that everyone remains enthusiastic, yet no one
    > feels overwhelmed.”

4.  Purpose and Contribution

    > “Any group of people working or living together does so for a
    > reason, though often unexpressed. What is it that you are able to
    > achieve collectively that you could not achieve individually?

    > “In asking yourself these kinds of questions, you should begin to
    > form an idea of what you contribute to the world through
    > your efforts.” — p. 73

> “Creating a quality of life statement requires a good deal of
> reflection and numerous conversations, and it may be several months
> …before it begins to express what you want to express. In the interest
> of moving on, however, start with a very rough statement that
> indicates the general direction in which you want to head. Then you
> can form the remaining two parts of you holistic goal and begin making
> decisions that lead you toward it.”

### Crafting Your Statement

> “In recording everyone’s thoughts initially, it is important that you
> capture them in simple phrases, rather than well-worded sentences …On
> the other hand, resist the temptation to break the phrases down into
> the values thay represent, ending up with a long list of values with
> no context ... they won’t adequately express how people want their
> lives to be, and that makes testing future decisions difficult.” — p.
> 74

> “This holistic goal you are forming is primarily for your own internal
> use. You do not have to show it to anyone else, so don’t worry about
> how well it reads. All that matters is that the words capture how you
> want your life to be in that particular whole, *and* that those words
> mean the same thing to each person.”

> “Once you have a rough draft of your quality of life statement, you
> will be ready to describe all the things you have to produce to create
> it.” — p. 75

Forms of Production
-------------------

> “In describing what you have to produce to create the way of life
> envisioned, you will naturally come to describe what you have to
> produce to effectively manage the whole …if yours is an organisation
> with a specific purpose, you also need to make sure you include what
> you ahve to produce to accoplish the stated purpose.” — p. 75

> “Each of the needs or desires expressed in you quality of life
> statement will have to met by some form of production. This doesn’t
> mean that you merely go thorugh each phrase in your statement and
> create a ‘product’ to match it …It becomes helpful if you ask a
> question: “What don’t we have now, or what aren’t we doing now, that
> is preventing us from *acheiving* this?”

> “If any of your desires included in your quality of life statement
> will require money to produce …then *profit* from whatever sources(s)
> you specify will need to be a form of production in most cases. In
> specifying the sources for that profit, it is important to do so in
> very general terms ... \[eg.\] ‘profit from toys’ ... ‘profit from the
> services we provide’ ... ‘surplus in our household budget’ ...” — p.
> 76

> “At least one of your forms of production will be to produce what you
> were specifically formed to produce, but many other forms of
> production will be influenced, and clarified, if your stated purpose
> is taken into account when expressing them.”

### Checklist (p. 77)

• Are all of the ideas expressed in the quality of life statement
covered? • Have you included what you must produce to achieve your
stated purpose (if applicable)? • Are there any “how to’s”? You only
want to list *what* has to be produced, not *how* it will be produced.
*How* something is to be produced is a decision that needs testing. • In
determining what you need to produce did any conflicts arise? If so,
then again it is probably because you were beginning to discuss how to
do something.

Future Resource Base
--------------------

> “There are several different elements to consider in describing your
> future resource base. Two that always should be addressed are the
> *people* you included in the resource base when defining your whole
> and the *land*, even if you did not make reference to it when defining
> your whole, and even when you operate a business that has not direct
> connection to the land. Other elements that may need to be considered
> are the *community you live or work in* and *the services available in
> that community*.” — p. 79

### People

> “…in describing the people in your future resource base you describe
> how you and your business, organisation, or whatever will have to be
> seen to be, far into the future, for ... people to remain loyal to
> you, respectful, or supportive, or whatever is required. Vary the
> attributes according to the people you are concerned about, whether
> they be clients and suppliers, extended family, environmental groups,
> or a representative from a regulatory agency.”

### The Land

> “\[Land\] needs to be included simply because in the long term, the
> well-being of any family, business, or community depends on the
> stability and productivity of the land surrounding them. When I say
> ‘land’ I am referring to it in the broadest sense meaning soils,
> plants, forest, birds, insects, wildlife, lakes, streams, and,
> ultimately, the oceans as well.” — p. 80

> “Arising from almost every financial transaction there is an effect on
> the land that is experienced months or years later and generally far
> removed from the site of the original transaction.” — p. 80

### The Community You Live In or Work In

> “…describe it as it will have to be to sustain what you have to
> produce to create your quality of life.”

> “In describing a community that is prosperous, racially harmonious,
> and rich in cultural amenities, you can begin making decisions that
> take you toward that.” — p. 82

### The Services Available in Your Community

> “Think carefully about your situation, and it you can see that there
> are services your community will have to have to be able to sustain
> what you produce, list them.” — p. 83

> “Once you have thought through and described all the elements that
> make up your future resource base, you will have a holistic goal.” —
> p. 83

Common Mistakes (p. 89)
-----------------------

> “When a goal focuses on a problem it provides no incentive to go
> beyond the problem to what people really want.”

> “…in forming a holistic goal, you always begin by expressing the
> quality of life you desire.”

> “*Do* make your holistic goal 100 percent *what* you want you want and
> have to produce and 0 percent *how* it is going to be achieved.”

> “*Don’t* allow any prejudices against future tools or actions to
> appear in the holistic goal.”

> “*Don’t* attempt to prioritise the ideas expressed in the quality of
> life statements”

> “*Don’t* quantify the forms of production in any way.”

> “The holistic goal should be formed by the people who will be living
> it, not by outsiders.”

> “Recognise that different levels of commitment will almost always
> exist when some of those who formed the holistic goal are somewhat
> removed from day-to-day management.”

Common Challenges
-----------------

> “Two of the greatest challenges in forming and refining a holistic
> goal lie first of all in the reluctance or inability many people have
> to express what they value most, and second, in trying to develop a
> holistic goal in a group that is not functioning well.” — p. 91

### Expressing Personal Values

> “…as the first step in forming a holistic goal is to identify what is
> most important to you, and because the rest of the holistic goal
> builds from that, ways must and can be found to make this easier.”

> “…the wording in a holistic goal will initially be rough and
> unrefined, but if formed properly will have meaning for all who
> produce it and are going to live or work by it.”

### Dealing with Disfunction

> “…I lean increasingly to forming the temporary holistic goal right
> away and beginning to make decisions towards it.”

Wholes within Wholes
--------------------

> “…when defining smaller wholes within a greater whole ...

1.  *Make sure that some of the decision makers in the greater whole
    also make decisions in the smaller wholes* …

2.  *Create a statement of purpose for each smaller whole.* …Each
    smaller whole has roles to serve and tasks to perform that support
    the greater whole, which the statement of purpose helps to
    clarify ...

3.  *Make sure the future resource base described in each entitiy’s
    holistic goal addresses client-supplier relationships.* …*At one
    time or another each is a client or supplier of the other.*

4.  *Clarify financial arrangements.*

General Quotes
==============

> “…self-sufficient life depends on the conversion of solar energy
> through green plants and into the stuff of life — food, fibre, and so
> on. Most of what we produce from the land will require the maximum
> enerfy converted both to maximise production and sustain it.” — p. 81

> “…the land manager’s concerns are ultimately everyone’s concerns if we
> are to sustain our economies, our civilization, and our planet.” — p
