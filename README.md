# Towards Critial Infrastructure

This is a documentation project. It consists of separate projects, each of which is directed towards addressing some aspect of aspects of Vinay Gupta's `Six Ways to Die` (6WTD) and `Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps`.

## Six Ways to Die

1. too hot
2. too cold
3. hunger
4. thirst
5. illness
6. injury

## Simple Critical Infrastructure Maps

In `Dealing in Security`, Gupta outlines a number of political actors:

1. the individual
2. the group
3. organisation
4. state

These documents will deal with the individual, groups of individuals and the organisations they create.

An individual has metabolic needs. It is these that the 6WTD apply to. Infrastructure is what provides for these needs and the further needs of grous / organisations.

A **group** has:
1. communications
2. shared space
3. resource control
4. transportation

Groups have **organisation** when there is:
1. a shared map of reality
2. a shared plan
3. a shared succession model
